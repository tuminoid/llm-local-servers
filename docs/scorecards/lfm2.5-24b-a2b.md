## Easy

Saturated or near-saturated at the frontier, still spread among small and
mid-size open models.

## Hard

Long-horizon software engineering where the frontier still scores low or models
spread widely.

## Vuln audit

Finding, reproducing, exploiting and patching vulnerabilities in real code;
CTF-style benchmarks are out of scope.

## Discrepancies

Benchmarks whose sources disagree; differing labels often mean a different
variant, harness or metric.
